## Overview

This project is a Custom Form built using React. It features a dynamic form where users can input data, and form fields can be customized based on requirements. The form includes validation, error handling, and a flexible structure to accommodate various types of form inputs such as text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and more.

## Features

Dynamic Form Fields: Create customizable form fields including text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.

Form Validation: Built-in client-side validation for required fields, email formats, and other input rules.

Error Handling: Provides error messages for invalid inputs and prevents form submission until all errors are resolved.

Responsive Design: The form layout adjusts to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Submission Handling: Captures form data and can send it to a backend API or display it on the screen.
