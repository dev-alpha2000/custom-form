Error Handling: Provides error messages for invalid inputs and prevents form submission until all errors are resolved.
Responsive Design: The form layout adjusts to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Submission Handling: Captures form data and can send it to a backend API or display it on the screen.
